# Create web applications with SweetPea
SweetPea is a tiny web development kit. It provides a client-server framework that any developer can use to build a dynamic web application. SweetPea is intended for prototyping, learning, and having fun with web applications.


It includes:

* A website for your user interface(s)
* A server for your back-end functionality

All you need to do is:
1. Build a user interface for the website.
    * [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org), [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/), and [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)


2. Develop software resources and create an Application Programming Interface (API) for the server.
    * [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/)


3. Call your API from the user interface.
    * [HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)

Figure 1 gives an architecture overview of the SweetPea web development kit. Visit the [glossary](docs/glossary.md) for term definitions.

## Get started with SweetPea
> ‚ö†Ô∏è These instructions were tested on a laptop running macOS Monterey 12.6 with an M1 chip.

In a terminal, navigate to the directory where you plan to install SweetPea and clone the [repository](https://github.com/eleblanc-ai/sweetpea).

    git clone https://github.com/eleblanc-ai/SweetPea.git

<a name="install-requirements">

### 1. Install the requirements
There are a few ways to install the project requirements. I used [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/), and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

To follow the instructions below, [install Homebrew ahead of time](https://brew.sh/). NPM and pip are installed automatically with NodeJS and Python3, respectively.

Install the requirements in the SweetPea project directory.

    cd SweetPea


#### Requirements:

1. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) -- *a cross-platform Javascript run-time environment for browsers.*

       brew install node

<!--$ node -v
v18.9.0-->
2. [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) -- *a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.*

       npm install react

<!--$ npm view react version
18.2.0-->


3. [Python](https://www.python.org/) -- *a language for developing the website's back-end functionality.*

       brew install python3

<!-- $ python3 --version
Python 3.10.6 -->

> üí°Ô∏è Optionally, use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for version management.

4. [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) -- *a web app framework for mapping HTTP requests from the website to Python functions.*

       pip3 install Flask


5. [Flask-cors](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) -- *a Flask extension for handling Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)*

       pip3 install flask-cors

> üí°Ô∏è In place of steps 4 and 5, you can run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
> in the `server` directory to install Flask and Flask-cors.

<!-- $ flask --version

Python 3.10.6
Flask 2.2.2
Werkzeug 2.2.2 -->

Once you've installed the requirements, you can start the server.



<a name="start-server">

### 2. Start the server

The server is a [basic Flask app](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/#a-minimal-application) that includes one demo endpoint called `time`. This endpoint returns the server's system time.

Start the server from the `SweetPea/server` directory in a new terminal tab or window.

    cd server    
    python3 Server.py

The output should look similar to the following:
```
 * Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: on
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on http://localhost:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 285-622-087
```
You can check that the server's demo endpoint is available by visiting http://localhost:5000/time in a browser, as shown in Figure 2.

</p>
<p align="center">Figure 2. Testing the server's demo endpoint.</p>

The server optionally accepts arguments for hostname, port, threaded mode, and debug mode as follows:
```
usage: Server.py [-h] [-n HOSTNAME] [-p PORT] [-t] [-d]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n HOSTNAME, --hostname HOSTNAME
                        set a hostname
  -p PORT, --port PORT  set a port for listening
  -t, --threaded        enable threaded mode
  -d, --debug           enable debug mode
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you change the server's hostname or port, you will also need to tell the website how to reach the server. To do so, update the following constants in `website/src/consts.js` to reflect your changes:
>* `SERVER_HOSTNAME`
>* `SERVER_PORT`
>
>
<!-- 
Later: 
"proxy":"http://localhost:5000" in package.json

https://create-react-app.dev/docs/proxying-api-requests-in-development/

You will also need to update the value of `proxy` in `website/package-json` to reflect the new port and hostname. --> 

You can set [additional arguments](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/api/#flask.Flask.run) for your Flask app by editing the `app.run` call in `Server.py`.

<a name="launch-website">

### 3. Launch the website

The website is an empty React application, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In a new terminal tab or window, install the website's dependencies to the `SweetPea/website` directory.

       npm install

> ‚ö†Ô∏è At this step, `npm audit` (which is run automatically as part of `npm install`) is [likely to report security vulnerabilities in dependency packages](https://overreacted.io/npm-audit-broken-by-design/). You can choose to [ignore the audit report](https://www.voitanos.io/blog/don-t-be-alarmed-by-vulnerabilities-after-running-npm-install/#how-should-you-handle-these-audit-reports). Otherwise, check out NPM's documentation on [auditing dependency packages for security vulnerabilities](https://docs.npmjs.com/auditing-package-dependencies-for-security-vulnerabilities).


<!-- If you choose instead to dig into any warnings that come up, then I recommend first checking out NPM's documentation on [auditing packages for security vulnerabilities](https://docs.npmjs.com/auditing-package-dependencies-for-security-vulnerabilities).--> 

Next, build and start the website.

        npm run build
        npm start

The output of `npm start` should look similar to this:
```
Compiled successfully!

You can now view frontend in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:3000

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use npm run build.

webpack compiled successfully

```
NPM should automatically open the website, shown in Figure 1 below. Otherwise, you can navigate to http://localhost:3000 to visit the website in your browser, as shown in Figure 3.

</p>
<p align="center">Figure 3. Launching the website.</p>

You can optionally [change the hostname and port for the website](https://dev.to/kevinmel2000/nodejs-reactjs-change-host-and-port-number-70b).

<a name="communication">

### 4. Test website and server communication

Now that the website and server are both online, you can verify that the two can talk to each other.
The website comes with a small demo that lets you test for communication between the website and server.

In the website, press the button to make a request to the server for a test message. If the request is successful, the response appears below the button, as shown in Figure 4.

  <img src="docs/fig/readme/test-connection.png" style="border: 2px solid #555" alt="A screen capture of a mouse clicking the `Press for test message button` in the website." The response appears below the button, reading "Hello, SweetPea!"/>
